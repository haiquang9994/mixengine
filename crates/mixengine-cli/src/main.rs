//! `mix` — the reference client. It renders what the daemon returns and decides nothing itself.
//!
//! Every command here is one RPC and one rendering. That is the rule from
//! [CLAUDE.md](../../../CLAUDE.md) — *no business logic in clients* — and it is why this binary is
//! shaped the way it is: the only decisions it makes on its own are which home it is talking about,
//! whether to start a daemon that is not running, and how to put the answer on screen. Everything
//! else is `mixengined`'s, including the wording of every failure.
//!
//! **Failures are the wire error, always.** Whether the daemon refused a call or `mix` never
//! reached one, what comes out is a `mixengine_proto::Error` — a stable code, one sentence, and a
//! hint where there is something to do. A script gets the same object out of `--json` in both cases
//! and can branch on `code` without caring which side of the socket produced it.

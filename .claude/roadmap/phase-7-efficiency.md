# Phase 7 — Efficiency

*Goal: deliver the promise that idle costs nothing.*

Part of the [build plan](todo.md). Legend: `[ ]` todo · `[~]` in progress · `[x]` done · **(P)** =
has a platform-layer component and needs verification on Windows + macOS + Linux.

---

- [x] **T68** `ResourceLimits` per OS: Job Objects, cgroup v2, macOS QoS; the API reports only
      what the platform really supports, so no client can offer a control that does nothing. **(P)**
      Design: [2026-08-26-t68-resource-limits-design.md](../../docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-26-t68-resource-limits-design.md).
      **The macOS watchdog came out of this task and became T71a**, below: warning and restarting at a
      threshold needs a per-process RSS sample taken repeatedly, and that sampler is T71. Building a
      second one here to serve one field on one operating system would put a loop in the supervisor
      that T71 would then replace.
      **What it does not prove, and who owes it.** Memory is proved by *outcome* — a `fakeservice`
      given 32 MB a bite and a 128 MB ceiling leaves `running` before it reaches 256 MB, and the
      suite was run once with the ceiling removed to check it can fail. **CPU is proved only by
      reading the value back out of the mechanism it was written into**, because a cap is a rate and
      asserting a rate means timing a busy loop on a shared runner. That a CPU cap *slows anything
      down* is **T72**'s, which has a `bench` job that knows how to compare against master.
      **Two things this task found that the design did not predict.** `SetInformationJobObject`
      refuses any `JobObjectCpuRateControlInformation` whose `ControlFlags` is `0` — measured, three
      shapes tried — so on Windows there is **no way to put a job back to having no rate control**
      once it has had some; removing a CPU cap writes `ENABLE` without `HARD_CAP` at a hundred per
      cent of the whole machine, which is the nearest true statement. And `cpu_percent` is a `u8`, so
      the "no more than `100 × cores`" refusal is **unreachable on any machine with three cores or
      more**: it guards a one-core VM and nothing else, which is written beside the check so nobody
      reads it as more than it is.
      **Where the honesty is enforced rather than asserted**: `LimitSupport` answers per *field*,
      because systemd delegates `memory` far more readily than `cpu` and a single flag could only
      describe that by lying about one of them — and `Unsupported` (this system never will) is a
      different variant from `Unavailable` (this machine currently will not), because they are
      different advice. `mix doctor` prints the second and deliberately says nothing about the first.
- [ ] **T69** Idle detection (connections, request counters, query counters) and `IdlePolicy`
      shutdown, with per-project "keep warm".
- [ ] **T70** On-demand activation gateway: hold the socket, start the service, wait for ready, proxy
      the first request.
- [ ] **T71** Metrics history: 1 s sampling while subscribed, 24-hour downsampled retention.
- [ ] **T71a** The macOS memory watchdog: warn at a `memory_mb` it cannot enforce, and restart at a
      threshold when the service asks to be. **Split out of T68**, and ordered here rather than there
      because it is the one part of `ResourceLimits` that is not a call on a kernel object — macOS has
      no hard memory cap, so the limit becomes a reading taken repeatedly and compared, which is
      T71's sampler and nothing else. Until this lands, `LimitSupport` answers `Unsupported` for
      memory on macOS and means it. **(P)**, though only one of the three does anything.
- [ ] **T72** CI budgets: idle footprint < 60 MB RSS, cold path < 1.5 s — failing the build on
      regression.
- [ ] **T73** Dev-tuned defaults pass over every service template (buffer pools, memory limits).

**Milestone M7** — after 30 idle minutes only `mixengined` + the web server are running, and the next
request still succeeds within budget.
